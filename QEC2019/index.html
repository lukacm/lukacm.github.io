</h1>
  
 <body>
   
   <h2> Organized by Martin Lukac (martin.lukac@nu.edu.kz), Wiliam N. Hung, Tomoyuki Araki </h2>
   
   <h3>Supported by IEEE CIS <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~whung/ETTC/">Task Force on Quantum Computing</a></h3>

   <h4> Scope and Topics</h4>
   <p>Quantum computing (QC) represents a broad topic encompassing a large number of approaches, technologies and techniques focusing on the usage, application, design and understanding of quantum computing systems. Evolutionary Computing (EC) have been on several occasions directly linked to quantum computing such as quantum evolutionary computation or evolutionary design for quantum computer design, etc. Because quantum computing evolves in the very large Complex Hilbert space, evolutionary methods are a prime tool for exploration and exploitation of quantum properties.</p>
   <p>The aim of this special session on quantum and evolutionary computing is to provide a platform for researchers of various Fields to discuss the latest advances in related fields, technologies and approaches linking and using quantum and evolutionary approaches. The scope of this special session covers among others but not limited to the following topics: </p>
<ul>
<li> Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms
<li> Classical Evolutionary Algorithms for Design of Quantum Computers
<li> Evolutionary Algorithms for Reversible and Quantum Circuits design
<li> Quantum Mechanics Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms
<li> Entanglement and Superposition in  Evolutionary algorithms
<li> Quantum Evolution
<li> Simulation of quantum systems using evolutionary computing
<li> Evolutionary optimization of quantum circuits
<li> Evolutionary design of quantum error correction
<li> Evolutionary design of hermitian operators
<li> Evolutionary design of quantum algorithms
<li> Quantum placement, Routing, and optimization on Gated Quantum Computers, One Way Quantum Computers
   </ul>

 <h4> Submission Details</h4>
   
   <p> Format should be conforming to the IEEE conference format with details about the submission being same to the specifications of the genera IEEE CEC conference
   <p> Paper submission should be using the same electronic way as for the general CEC 2019 <a href="http://cec2019.org/papers.html#submission"> here</a>

  <p>He started his career at Intel in 1997 applying formal methods to the design and verification process of leading edge microprocessors. In 2004, he left Intel to join Synplicity and worked on FPGA synthesis. Since 2007, he has been working at Synopsys and primarily focused on emulation, prototyping, and constraint based verification. He is currently a Group Director at Synopsys.
  <p>William is serving as an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on CAD and IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II. He served on the Technical Program Committee (TPC) of several conferences including DAC (Design Automation Conference), ICCAD, DATE, ICCD, CAV, FMCAD, WCCI, CEC, etc. He was the Chair of the Quantum Computing Task Force of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society, and he also served as Chair of High-level, Behavioral and Logic Synthesis Track in the ICCAD TPC and as Co-Chair of the Logic and Circuit Track in the ICCD TPC. He has 20+ years of industrial R&D experience, 80+ papers published, and he is the inventor of numerous patents. He gave an invited talk to CAV 2015 and ISPD 2018.
   
  <H5>Tomoyuki Araki:</H5>
   <p> Tomoyuki Araki received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from Meiji University, Kanagawa, in 1985, 1987, and 2000, respectively. After working in IBM Japan, Ltd. from 1987 to 1991, he joined the Kanagawa Institute of Technology. Since 2002, he has been with Hiroshima Institute of Technology, where he is currently a Professor with the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering. His research interests include applications of multiple-valued logic, fuzzy logic, quantum computing, and information networks. Prof. Araki is a member of the IEEE, the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers of Japan (IEICE) and the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ).
